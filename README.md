## 👤 About me

**Hi there! I'm Sam, a beginner Games Designer who is still in education and I am working hard to develop my skills.**

Currently I am studying in the United Kingdom at college in order to complete a Level 3 Diploma in Games Design (Creative Practice: Art, Design and Communication). I am a specialised programmer who works in Unity and most prominently with C#, developing game mechanics and designs, creating my own individual projects designed from the ground up as well as working with classmates on group projects based on my skills as a programmer and designer.

I began my journey with programming at Secondary School where I took up a Computer Science GCSE and attended extracurricular programming classes, developing skills using **Python** in the **IDLE editor**, I have always had a deep passion for programming and undertaking the problem solving that comes with it. Using the **IDLE editor** I solved basic industry and software problems with **Python** as well as working on my own personal mini-game projects.

<br>

Following this passion I took up a **Level 3 Diploma in Games Design** at Penwith College which is where I am studying now. In my first year on this Diploma, I developed my first complete games within **Unity**, such as a [Horror Clicker Game](https://youtu.be/4l4xoVPqt14), learning to program in **C#** with **Microsoft Visual Studio**. For this Clicker Game project, I used my own assets made from a previous project where I developed skills using **3DS Max** and created and textured a fully rendered and complete alleyway scene, which I used as the environment for the project, combining my skills together.
I also created another game for my final project of this year, a short demo level of [Timewarp](https://youtu.be/iA6vY71C8d8), a Narrative-driven Puzzle Game, focused around the themes of nature and time, as provided as the themes for this project.

During my first year at college I also got the opportunity to attend a week long **Games Jam**, working in a group of other college students to create a game focused on the theme of 'Chaos', together we worked on a short, mechanics-driven sandbox game centered around the viewpoint of a child in a fully destructible supermarket. Unfortunately we did not bring this game to market, however the experience gained from this was undoubtedly invaluable.

As of currently, within my second year on this Diploma I have completed a [Sound Design Project](https://youtu.be/azRty6Pg5ZM), recreating the sounds of a game trailer using copyright-free libraries and **Foley**, skills which I later used to develop the **audio design** behind my most current and high-level game, [ULTRAKILL: Pinball](https://youtu.be/Jw5zIvuWlEY), a massive [showcase](https://youtu.be/2j_xjuMkq8U) of my skills so far.
