## 👤 About me

**Hi there! I'm Sam, a beginner Games Designer who is still in education and I am working hard to develop my skills.**

Currently I am studying in the United Kingdom at college in order to complete a Level 3 Diploma in Games Design (Creative Practice: Art, Design and Communication). I am a specialised programmer who works in Unity and most prominently with C#, developing game mechanics and designs, creating my own individual projects designed from the ground up as well as working with classmates on group projects based on my skills as a programmer and designer.
